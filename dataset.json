You can easily spot if it is a built-in function, variable, and so on. Appropriate color combinations in a theme is also important to make codes readable because colors send different signals to the brain, for example, too many red fonts could mean error. Sometimes colors can also give varying feeling or changing mood to users that may affect the development process, I think that is best explained in Psychology of colors.","createdon":"2020-11-25T12:26:29.306Z","__v":0},{"userresponse":[{"question":1,"label":"C. 3","value":"C","rawobj":{"question":1,"id":3,"name":"C. 3","value":"C"},"endstamp":"1606384020445"},{"question":2,"label":"C. 1","value":"C","rawobj":{"question":2,"id":3,"name":"C. 1","value":"C"},"endstamp":"1606384047890"},{"question":3,"label":"D.
